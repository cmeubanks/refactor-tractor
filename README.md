## Abstract

This Webpack Kit is a refactor of a project that needed updating. 

## Clone This Repo

1. Fork and clone the Repo to your local manchine
2. cd into the repo
3. Run: `npm install`

## Setup

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.


### Images

Add your image files in the `src/images` directory. Similar to CSS files, you need to `import` image files in the JavaScript entry file (`index.js`). Then go into the HTML and add an `img` element with the `src` attribute pointing to the `images` directory. There is an example in the `index.html` file for you to see.


## Running Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

`npm test`


<!-- If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages. -->

## Description

This Webpack Kit is a refactor of a project that was in need of updating. Users can use our search to find specific recipes. Recipes can also be sorted by tags using our fully functional tag filtering aside. Users can favorite recipes by clicking the star button on any recipe card in the main display.


### Notable Features
* Fully functional aside to filter all recipes by multiple tags
* Search functionality in the navigation bar
* Favorited recipes display
* Pantry view to display all ingredients in pantry, all recipes a user would like to cook, and a grocery list that users can add ingredients to.
